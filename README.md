# 🦠 COVID-19 Statistics Visualization Project

A data analysis and visualization project focused on exploring COVID-19 statistics using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The project utilizes CSV files as the data source and includes a PDF document to illustrate the output and insights generated.

## 🎯 Objectives

- To analyze COVID-19 trends using real-world data in CSV format.
- To create visualizations that highlight key patterns such as infection rates, recovery trends, and regional comparisons.
- To practice data cleaning, transformation, and visualization using Python libraries.
- To share reproducible code and output using a Jupyter Notebook and PDF.

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python** – Core programming language for analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)** – Interactive coding and visualization environment.
- **Pandas** – For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – For plotting graphs and visualizing trends.
- **CSV Files** – Raw COVID-19 data input.
- **PDF Export** – Demonstrates the results and running code in a shareable format.
