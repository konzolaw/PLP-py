# ü¶† COVID-19 Statistics Visualization Project

A data analysis and visualization project focused on exploring COVID-19 statistics using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The project utilizes CSV files as the data source and includes a PDF document to illustrate the output and insights generated.

## üéØ Objectives

- To analyze COVID-19 trends using real-world data in CSV format.
- To create visualizations that highlight key patterns such as infection rates, recovery trends, and regional comparisons.
- To practice data cleaning, transformation, and visualization using Python libraries.
- To share reproducible code and output using a Jupyter Notebook and PDF.

## üß∞ Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python** ‚Äì Core programming language for analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)** ‚Äì Interactive coding and visualization environment.
- **Pandas** ‚Äì For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** ‚Äì For plotting graphs and visualizing trends.
- **CSV Files** ‚Äì Raw COVID-19 data input.
- **PDF Export** ‚Äì Demonstrates the results and running code in a shareable format.
